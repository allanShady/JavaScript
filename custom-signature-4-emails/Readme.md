![final result](https://github.com/allanShady/Javacript-playground/blob/master/custom-signature-4-emails/assets/images/final-result.PNG)

I get the inspiration from [this post](https://academind.com/learn/css/build-a-custom-email-signature/) from [academind](https://academind.com/)

To dos 
- [x] Design your custom signature using a tool like [figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [x] Get free icons, [free online tool recommend](https://uxwing.com/)
- [x] Change the icons to your preferred color, [free online tool](https://onlinepngtools.com/change-png-color#:~:text=World's%20simplest%20online%20Portable%20Network,new%20colors%20on%20the%20right.)
- [x] Resize the icons to preferred size, usually 100px
- [x] Rename the icons properly 
- [x] Make them globally accessible by hosting on your preferred CDN. I do recommend [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- [x] Design the signature using html tags. if you like you can just use the tags listed bellow:
    * ``` <table> ```
    * ``` <tbody> ```
    * ``` <tr> ```
    * ``` <td> ```
- [x] Preview the html page
- [x] Select all content using left button mouse
- [x] Go to your email
    * Access the configuration -> add new signature 
    * Past the content you copied from browser
    * Set the new signature to used while creating or replying a new email
- [x] Create a new email to test!

### Thank you! 😊🙏🏿💪
